# üìå Detailed Test Case Documentation: Homogeneous Buckley-Leverett with capillarity effects

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this test case is to numerically verify the accuracy of capturing the saturation front in an **immiscible two-phase flow (water-oil displacement)** within a **homogeneous** porous medium **with capillarity effects**. The verification is performed by comparing the numerical results with a reference solution, which is obtained by running this case with a time step of 1e-4 s, which is a much finer time step compared to the original time step of 100.0 s.

## üìñ Test Case Description

- **Domain:** 1D along the Y-axis, with:
  - **Length (Y):** `0.065 m`
  - **Width and Depth (X and Z):** `0.035 m √ó 0.035 m`
- **Porous medium:** homogeneous and isotropic.
- **Initial saturation:** The domain is initially fully saturated with oil (no water present at $t=0$).

This scenario reproduces the conditions of the classic Buckley-Leverett problem, checking whether the simulation can correctly capture the water saturation front advancing through the porous medium.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solver Description

The case uses **`coupledMatrixFoam`**, a fully implicit solver based on an Euler-Euler multifluid formulation and Darcy‚Äôs law for each phase flowing through the porous medium. Key features include:

- **Implicit coupling** of phase-fraction and pressure equations.
- **Numerical stability** even for relatively large time steps.
- **Based on foam-extend (OpenFOAM) 5.0**.

For more details on the solver‚Äôs formulation and block-coupled approach, see the references at the end.

## üî® Detailed Numerical Setup

### 1. Porous Medium Properties

- **Porosity** ($\phi$): `0.2`
- **Absolute Permeability** ($K$): $1\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m}^2$
- Defined in `invK.rock` as:
  $$
  invK_{rock} = \frac{1}{K} \times factor \\
  $$
  with a normalization factor of $1\times10^{-4}$. This normalization factor is used to bring the pressure values closer to the phase volume fraction values, as they are being resolved in the coupled nonlinear system.

- The rock volume fraction is defined in `alpha.rock` as:
  $$
  alpha.rock = 1 - \phi \\
  $$

### 2. Relative Permeability Model

A **Brooks-Corey** model consistent with the homogeneous Buckley-Leverett approach was used:

- **Water relative permeability**: $k_{rw} = S_w^2$
- **Oil relative permeability**: $k_{ro} = S_o^2$

This is set on `constant/phaseProperties`.

> In a Buckley-Leverett test, these exponents produce a characteristic shock front progression.


### 3. Capillarity Model

A **Brooks-Corey** model was used:

$$
  p_{c,ow} = p_{c,0} \left(\frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_{void}}\right)^{-\beta}, \\
$$
where $p_{c,0} = 10 Pa$ and $\beta = 0.5$.

Since the capillary pressure must also be multiplied by $factor$, we set it in `constant/phaseProperties` as follows:

$$
  p_{c,0,normalized} = p_{c,0} \times factor. \\
$$

### 4. Fluid Physical Properties

Water has a density of 1000‚ÄØkg/m¬≥ and a dynamic viscosity of 0.001‚ÄØPa¬∑s, while
 oil has a lower density of 800‚ÄØkg/m¬≥ and a higher viscosity of 0.002‚ÄØPa¬∑s.

These values are typical for laboratory-scale water-oil displacement experiments.
This is set on `constant/phaseProperties`.

### 5. Initial Conditions

- Oil volume fraction (`alpha.oil`) = `0.2`
- Water volume fraction (`alpha.water`) = `0`

Hence, the entire domain is initially 100% oil saturated.

### 6. Boundary Conditions

**Inlet (Y=0):**

- A constant **superficial volumetric flow rate** of water:
  $$
  U_w = 2.7102 \times 10^{-6} \, m/s \\
  $$
- Since the solver uses an interstitial flux in `U.water`, we convert:
  $$
  U_{w,interstitial} = \frac{U_w}{\phi} = 1.3551 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^3/s \\
  $$

**Outlet (Y=0.065 m):**

- Fixed pressure boundary condition:
  $$
  p_{real} = 1 \times 10^3 \text{Pa} \\
  $$
- Since permeability was normalized, pressure must also be normalized by the same factor:
  $$
  p_{normalized} = p_{real} \times factor \\
  $$

### 7. Gravity

- The gravity vector is set in `constant/g`. In standard Buckley-Leverett cases, gravity is typically negligible.

## üöÄ Case Execution

1. **Enable the environment**
   Make sure to run, for example:
   ```bash
   source /path/to/foam-extend-5.0/etc/bashrc
   ```
2. **Run `Allrun`**
   - Generates the mesh with `blockMesh`.
   - Executes the solver `coupledMatrixFoam`.
   - Performs data extraction for comparison with `sample`.

3. **Clean**
   To remove previous results and start fresh, run:
   ```bash
   ./Allclean
   ```

---

## üìä Post-processing and Validation

- **sampleDict**: Extracts water saturation values along the domain (e.g., `acrossFlow_S.water.xy`).
- **Quantitative Error Metrics**
  We suggest computing mean and maximum absolute errors compared to the reference solution to quantify accuracy.
- **automation.py**
  This Python script (in the `scripts` folder) compares the simulation output (e.g., `../postProcessing/sets/<time>/acrossFlow_S.water.xy`) with the reference data in `reference.csv`, producing a saturation plot (`comp.png`).


---

## üßÆ Model Equations (Summary)

1. **Darcy‚Äôs Law for phase $i$**:
   $$
   \alpha_i U_i = -\frac{k_{r,i}}{\mu_i} K (\nabla p_i - \rho_i g) \\
   $$
2. **Phase Mass Conservation**:
   $$
   \frac{\partial \alpha_i}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\alpha_i U_i) = 0 \\
   $$
3. **Closure condition**:
   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i = 1 \\
   $$
