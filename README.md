Project ongoing..

Containgn different solvers, including:
binaryCompositionalDarcyFoam: a version of idealCompositionalFoam based on coupledMatrixFoam code,
quaternaryCompositionalDarcyFoam: the 4-component solver containing CO2, H2O, Na and Cl,
quaternaryNsCompositionalDarcyFoam: the 4-component solver containing CO2, H2O, Na and Cl with solid salt and no reactions,
compositionalDarcyFoam: the 4-component solver containing CO2, H2O, Na and Cl with solid salt and reactions (developments ongoing ...)
